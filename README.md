# West Nile Virus Outbreak Prediction

### Introduction and Problem Statement

In urban environments, the proliferation of mosquito populations poses significant public health risks, notably the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as West Nile Virus (WNV). Where in many individuals WNV do not present symptoms, infection can lead to serious neurological disease and there is no vaccination avaliable for use in humans. Chicago, with its diverse ecosystems ranging from urban landscapes to natural water bodies, experiences seasonal surges in mosquito populations, leading to increased instances of WNV infections among its residents. The dynamic and often unpredictable nature of mosquito population growth, influenced by factors such as weather conditions, urbanization, and ecological changes, complicates efforts to control the spread of WNV.

The necessity for an effective strategy to mitigate the health risks associated with WNV in Chicago underscores the importance of a data-driven approach to vector surveillance and control. Traditional methods of mosquito monitoring and disease prevention have relied on generalized, reactive measures. By analyzing data on mosquito populations, environmental conditions, and historical WNV outbreaks, we can uncover patterns and predictors in order to develop proactive strategies mitigating WNV outbreaks. 

The problem, therefore, can be addressed through predictive modelling that can accurately forecast WNV outbreaks based on mosquito population dynamics and environmental variables. Such models would enable public health officials to implement targeted vector control strategies, optimize resource allocation, raise public awareness and ultimately reduce the incidence of WNV among the population. The objective of this project is to identify key factors relating to mosquito population growth, particularly of the Culex genus which are deemed to be the principal vector of the disease, employing machine learning techniques to enhance our understanding and management of WNV transmission associated with mosquito populations in Chicago.
